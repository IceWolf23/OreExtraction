# This plugin modifies vanilla extraction

Digging an ore with a pickaxe will extract it from the rough block, dropping the ore, leaving cobblestone, cobbled deepslate, netherrack or blackstone in its place, depending on the ore excavated

Creative players will not be affected
Permission node to use: `oreexcavation.use`

Digging with a pickaxe enchanted with SilkTouch will **not leave the block of cobblestone/etc**

Compatible with:
- [GriefPrevention](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/griefprevention.1884/) 
- [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard/files)
